# Majdoori

**Majdoori** is a web application designed to bridge the gap between rural laborers and potential clients, providing a platform for workers (majdoors) in rural India to showcase their skills and connect with those who need their services. The app focuses on bringing employment opportunities to those who may not have easy access to traditional job markets.

## Features

- **Worker Profiles**: Laborers can create profiles, listing their skills, experience, and availability.
- **Client Requests**: Clients can post job requests, search for workers based on skills, and hire them directly through the app.
- **Search Functionality**: Advanced search options allow clients to filter workers by location, skillset, and experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both mobile devices and desktops.
- **Localization**: The app supports multiple languages, with a focus on Hindi to cater to the rural population.
- **Secure Authentication**: Users (both workers and clients) can sign up and log in securely using the latest authentication protocols.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, Material-UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (or other alternatives as per project needs)
- **API**: RESTful APIs for communication between frontend and backend
